# Course Outcomes Examples

## Sample Course Outcomes (Based on Bloom's Taxonomy)

This document provides example Course Outcomes that can be added to the Question Paper Creator for CO-PO mapping.

### Computer Science - Software Engineering Course

| CO No. | Course Outcome Statement | Bloom's Level | PO Mapping |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------|------------|
| CO1 | Understand the principles of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models | Understanding | PO1, PO2 |
| CO2 | Apply software design patterns in real-world projects | Applying | PO3, PO4 |
| CO3 | Analyze software requirements using various elicitation techniques | Analyzing | PO5, PO6 |
| CO4 | Create comprehensive test plans and test cases for software systems | Creating | PO3, PO12 |
| CO5 | Evaluate software quality metrics and apply industry standards | Evaluating | PO5, PO9 |
| CO6 | Design and implement complete software solutions for complex problems | Creating | PO3, PO4, PO12 |

### Usage in Question Paper Creator

When creating a question paper, you can:

1. **Add Course Outcomes**: Click "Add Course Outcome" and enter:
   - CO Number (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
   - CO Statement (the learning objective)
   - Bloom's Level (select from dropdown)

2. **Select Target COs**: Check the COs you want the question paper to assess

3. **Generate CO-Aligned Questions**: When you use AI features (suggestions or custom prompts), the system will:
   - Consider the selected Course Outcomes
   - Generate questions at the appropriate Bloom's level
   - Ensure questions assess the specified learning objectives

### Example Workflow

**Scenario**: Creating a midterm exam for Software Engineering

1. **Add COs**: Add CO1 through CO6 as shown above
2. **Select COs**: Check CO1, CO2, CO3, CO4 (midterm coverage)
3. **Generate Questions**: Use AI prompt like:
   ```
   Create 5 questions for a software engineering midterm exam:
   - 2 questions at Understanding level
   - 2 questions at Applying level  
   - 1 question at Analyzing level
   Total marks should be 50.
   ```
4. **AI Output**: The AI will generate questions specifically aligned with:
   - CO1 (Understanding SDLC) - Understanding level questions
   - CO2 (Apply design patterns) - Application level questions
   - CO3 (Analyze requirements) - Analysis level questions
   - CO4 (Create test plans) - Creating level questions

### Benefits of CO Mapping

1. **Curriculum Alignment**: Ensures questions assess specific learning outcomes
2. **Bloom's Taxonomy Compliance**: Maintains appropriate cognitive level distribution
3. **PO Attainment**: Helps track Program Outcome achievement through assessment
4. **Quality Assurance**: Creates more educationally sound assessments
5. **Accreditation**: Provides evidence for NAAC, NBA, and other accreditation bodies

### Integration with AI

When CO mapping is enabled, the AI receives context like:

```
Generate questions that specifically assess these learning outcomes at their designated Bloom's taxonomy levels:

CO1: Understand the principles of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models (Bloom's Level: understanding)
CO2: Apply software design patterns in real-world projects (Bloom's Level: application)
CO3: Analyze software requirements using various elicitation techniques (Bloom's Level: analysis)
```

This ensures the AI generates relevant, outcome-focused questions rather than generic ones.
