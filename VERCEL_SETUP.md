# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

To deploy Evalis-GT on Vercel, you need to set up the following environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

## Database Configuration
```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgresql_connection_string
```

## Authentication
```
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_minimum_32_characters
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
```

## Server Configuration
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

## Redis Configuration (Optional - for session management)
```
REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string
```

## Firebase Configuration (Optional - if using Firebase features)
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email
```

## How to Set Environment Variables on Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Make sure to select the appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## Important Notes:

- The app will automatically detect Vercel environment and use serverless functions
- File uploads will be handled in memory (Vercel doesn't support persistent file storage)
- Database connections are managed with connection pooling for serverless
- Sessions will use JWT tokens instead of Redis in serverless environment

## Build Process:

Vercel will automatically:
1. Run `npm run vercel-build` 
2. Build the frontend with Vite
3. Install server dependencies
4. Deploy as serverless functions
