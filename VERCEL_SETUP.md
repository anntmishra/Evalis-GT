# Vercel Environment Variables Setup

**Status: ÔøΩÔ∏è WHITE PAGE FIXED - Updated August 14, 2025**  
**Latest Fix:** Added frontend-only mode to prevent API call failures  
**Vercel Status:** New deployment with white page fix in progress

## ‚úÖ White Page Issue Resolution

The white page issue was caused by the frontend trying to make API calls to a backend that wasn't deployed on Vercel. 

**What was fixed:**
- Added `IS_FRONTEND_ONLY` mode detection for Vercel deployments
- Modified AuthContext to skip API validation in frontend-only mode  
- Added demo mode notification banner
- Updated environment configuration to handle missing backend gracefully

**Current behavior:**
- Vercel deployment will show a "Demo Mode" banner
- Frontend loads properly without backend API calls
- No more white page errors

To deploy Evalis-GT on Vercel, you can optionally set up the following environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

## Database Configuration
```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgresql_connection_string
```

## Authentication
```
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret_minimum_32_characters
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
```

## Server Configuration
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

## Redis Configuration (Optional - for session management)
```
REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string
```

## Firebase Configuration (Optional - if using Firebase features)
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email
```

## How to Set Environment Variables on Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with its value
5. Make sure to select the appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)

## Deployment Status:

‚úÖ **Build Dependencies Fixed**: All build tools moved to dependencies  
‚úÖ **Package.json Optimized**: Removed duplicate entries, clean build  
‚úÖ **Local Builds Passing**: Consistent successful builds  
‚úÖ **Git Repository Updated**: Latest changes pushed to main branch  
‚úÖ **White Page Fixed**: Added frontend-only mode for Vercel  
üöÄ **Vercel Deployment**: Auto-deploying with white page fix  

## Frontend-Only Mode (Current Deployment):

The current Vercel deployment runs in **frontend-only mode**, which means:
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI loads properly with demo mode banner
- ‚ùå Backend API features are disabled (login, data management)
- üéØ Perfect for showcasing the UI and design
- üîß Backend can be added later via Vercel serverless functions

## Important Notes:

- The app will automatically detect Vercel environment and use serverless functions
- File uploads will be handled in memory (Vercel doesn't support persistent file storage)
- Database connections are managed with connection pooling for serverless
- Sessions will use JWT tokens instead of Redis in serverless environment

## Build Process:

Vercel will automatically:
1. Run `npm run vercel-build` 
2. Build the frontend with Vite
3. Install server dependencies
4. Deploy as serverless functions

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues:

If your Vercel deployment isn't updating despite successful builds and pushes:

### 1. Force New Deployment
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Check Vercel Dashboard
- Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
- Select your project
- Check the "Deployments" tab for build logs
- Look for any failed deployments or errors

### 3. Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: Deployment not triggering**
- Solution: Check if the repository is properly connected in Vercel
- Solution: Verify the branch is set to `main` in Vercel settings

**Issue: Build succeeds but site doesn't update**
- Solution: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Solution: Check if you're viewing the correct deployment URL

**Issue: Build fails on Vercel but works locally**
- Solution: Check environment variables are set correctly
- Solution: Ensure all dependencies are in `dependencies` not `devDependencies`

### 4. Verify Deployment Status
Check these URLs after deployment:
- Production: Your custom domain or `yourproject.vercel.app`
- Latest deployment: Check the deployment URL from Vercel dashboard

### 5. Force Cache Refresh
```bash
# Clear Vercel build cache (if you have Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod --force
```
